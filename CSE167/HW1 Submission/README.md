# Custom Scene
My custome scene for HW1.7 is in
submission>scenes>hw1>custom_scene>pochita.json

The rendering is in
submission>outputs>hw_1_7_pochita.png

# Bonus: Bounding Box for Circles
NO ACCELERATION:
hw1_2_scene_0 took 0.0236918 seconds.

hw1_2_scene_custom_1 took 0.104109 seconds.

WITH ACCELERATION:
hw1_2_scene_0 took 0.0116787 seconds.

hw1_2_scene_custom_1 took 0.0116613 seconds.

Since there is no need to iterate over the entire canvas anymore the code is executed much faster.

This was only implemented for circles as suggested by a TA.

# Bonus: Animation
My three frames for the animation can be found in
submission>scenes>h1>animation>
frame1.json
frame2.json
frame3.json

The animated gif is in
submission>outputs>hw_1_4_animation>hw_1_animated.gif

and the three frames can be found in the same folder
